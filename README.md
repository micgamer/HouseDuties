### Open Source Project for List Randomization by Michael Schrag

The purpose of this package is to take a list of duties, and a list of names, and randomize the assignments.

#### How It Works

+1. The first line is the number of list items (people and jobs need to be the same length.
+2. The next lines are the job titles followed by a pipe and then the name
++ e.g. Clean Faucets|George Orwell
+3. Make sure that the file containing the above information is titled "in.txt" and is in the working directory
+4. there will be an out.txt file generated with the randomized duty assignments!

Hope it comes in handy,
Michael Schrag
